INSERT
1) INSERT into links VALUES("http://disney.com", "disne", 50, CURDATE());
2) No, the Atomocity property guarantees that all updates are "all or nothing"
   in that either they go to completion before another access, or they don't
   happen at all.

UPDATE
1) UPDATE links SET hit_count = hit_count + 1 WHERE long_url = 'http://disney.com';
   SELECT * links where long_url = 'http://disney.com' 
       ==> hit_count = 51
