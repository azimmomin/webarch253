                <h4> There are a few reasons. Here they are from most to least important:
                    <ul>
                        <li> I really like web design and this is my first real try at it. </li>
                        <li> I wanted to share my music tastes with people. </li>
                        <li> It was an assignment for a class. </li>
                    <ul>
                </h4>
                <h2>What should you do?</h2>
